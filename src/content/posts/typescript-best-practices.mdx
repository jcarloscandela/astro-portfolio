# TypeScript Best Practices for 2025

TypeScript continues to evolve, and with it, our best practices should too. Here's what you need to know for 2025.

## Type Inference

Leverage TypeScript's powerful type inference system while maintaining readability:

```typescript
// Let TypeScript infer complex types
const result = await api.fetchData() // inferred type
```

## Strict Mode Benefits

Always enable strict mode in your TypeScript projects:

- Catches more potential errors
- Better type safety
- Improved maintainability
- Enhanced IDE support

## Pattern Matching

The new pattern matching features in TypeScript make code more expressive and safer:

```typescript
type Response = Success | Error | Loading

// Pattern matching ensures all cases are handled
const status = match(response) {
  Success -> "✅",
  Error -> "❌",
  Loading -> "⏳"
}
```
