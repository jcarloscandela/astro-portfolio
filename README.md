GitHub Pages offers two deployment options:

- **Repository Name**: Any name (e.g., `my-portfolio`, `blog`)
- **Deployed URL**: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`
- **Setup**: Use any repository name, no special configuration needed

#### Option 2: User Site (Root Domain)
- **Repository Name**: Must be exactly `[your-username].github.io` (e.g., `jcarloscandela.github.io`)
- **Deployed URL**: `https://[your-username].github.io/` (root domain)
- **Setup**: 
  1. Rename your repository to `[your-username].github.io`
  2. Update the Astro configuration if needed (the template supports both options)

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" → "Pages"
   - Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source

2. Push your code to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your site

## Adding Components

shadcn/ui provides pre-built, accessible UI components. To add one:

1. Follow the official [Astro installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/astro).
2. Pick a component (e.g., [Accordion](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion), [Dialog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/dialog)) and follow the usage instructions.

> [!NOTE] 
> In Astro, an [island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) is an interactive component rendered on the client. For complex or dynamic components, check [Add a Shadcn UI Component | Space Madness Stack](https://spacemadness.dev/docs/add-a-shadcn-ui-component)
