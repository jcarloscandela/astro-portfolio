## Adding Components

shadcn/ui provides pre-built, accessible UI components. To add one:

1. Follow the official [Astro installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/astro).
2. Pick a component (e.g., [Accordion](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion), [Dialog](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/dialog)) and follow the usage instructions.

> [!NOTE] 
> In Astro, an [island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) is an interactive component rendered on the client. For complex or dynamic components, check [Add a Shadcn UI Component | Space Madness Stack](https://spacemadness.dev/docs/add-a-shadcn-ui-component)

If you're new to using React (or other frameworks) inside Astro, start with the [Framework Components guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/).
